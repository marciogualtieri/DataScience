# Data Cleaning: Wearable Computing, Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

This project uses the [R language](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) to perform data cleaning on raw data-sets comprised of motion sensor data. For information on the original raw data and transformation steps performed to obtain the final clean data-sets refer to [`CodeBook.md`](./CodeBook.md). This code book is rendered using [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/) from the source file [`CodeBook.Rmd`](./CodeBook.Rmd), which is a [R notebook](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html).

Running the R notebook from [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), one can render the code book and execute all commands necessary to generate the clean data-sets, but given that the specification asked for a R script, the data cleaning can also be performed by executing [`run_analysis.R`](./run_analysis.R).

The folder [`tidy_data`](./tidy_data) contains the clean data-sets generated by the R script (or notebook):

|Data File                             |Contents                                                                                  |

|./tidy_data/activity_data.txt         |Clean data-set with means and standard deviations for all motion sensor measurements.     |
|./tidy_data/activity_averages_data.txt|Averages of all motion sensor measurements in the clean data-set per subject and activity.|

Information about the clean data-sets variables can be found in the code book as well.
