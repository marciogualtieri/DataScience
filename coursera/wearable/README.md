# Wearable Computing: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

This project uses the [R language](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) to perform data cleaning on a raw data-set comprised of motion sensor data. For information on the original raw data and transformation steps performed to obtain the final cleanup data-set refer to [`CodeBook.md`](./CodeBook.md).

This code book is a generated file rendered using [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/) from the source file [`CodeBook.Rmd`](./CodeBook.Rmd), which is a [R notebook](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html).

Running the R notebook from [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), one can render the code book and execute all commands necessary to generate the clean data-sets.

Given that the specification asked for a R script, the data cleaning can also be performed by executing [`run_analysis.R`](./run_analysis.R).

The folder `tidy_data` contains the cleanup data-sets generated by the R script (or notebook):

|./tidy_data/activity_data.csv         |Cleanup data-set with means and standard deviations for all motion sensor measurements.|
|./tidy_data/activity_averages_data.csv|Averages of all motion sensor measurements per  activity.                              |

Information about the clean data-sets can be found in the code book as well.
